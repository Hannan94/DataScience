I took the housing dataset which contains information about different houses in King County,Washington between 2014 and 2015.This dataset can be accessed from kaggle. There are 20163 samples and 20 feature variables in this dataset. The objective was to predict the prices houses using the given features.

The prices of the house indicated by the variable 'price' was the target variable and the remaining were the feature variabes that I used to predict the target variable.
